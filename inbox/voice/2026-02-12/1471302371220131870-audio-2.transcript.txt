So in terms of the court injunction about this, what the schools do and you take
the examples, you're living in a Scandinavian forest city, you go to a orchestral
production of the four seasons and the director has introduced this take on it
where some of the birds that come in right and you take that from someone who has
been in a city where there has recently been bombing raids and that same
production and the sensation of the people right because that's because sound
exists within the context and actually sound has been used as a warning vehicle.
It's so deep in the evolution of beings that just pretend it isn't, it's
egregious and it's an abuse of a position as an educator to pretend that the
type of sound you use doesn't have some kind of psychological effect. It's
it's frankly astonishing and worrying.
