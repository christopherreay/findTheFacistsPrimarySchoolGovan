## Gist (rough)
Sound is not neutral: the psychological meaning of the same production (e.g. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons with birds) changes depending on context (forest city vs recently bombed city). Sound is evolutionarily deep as warning; educators pretending the choice of sound has no psychological effect is an abuse/neglect. Mentions a “court injunction” dimension.

## Candidate threads
- sound-as-signal: context-dependent perception
- school sound environments: trauma-informed design vs coercion
- legal/policy constraints (injunctions, safeguarding)
